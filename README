INSTALLATION:

-WINDOWS: A precompiled binary version is available for windows.  Click the "Downloads" button above and select the "imagine win32 installer" package. Or you may choose to build from source as described below.

-BUILDING FROM SOURCE (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, etc.):

Pre-requisites: This application needs libtiff (www.libtiff.org). Libtiff is preinstalled on Mac Os X and many unix systems.  Windows users will need to download the library (and dependencies...also available from the above link) and put these dll files in c:/windows/system32 (nowhere else will work as I presently have the build configured).

Then download the source and build the application for your system (windows, mac, linux, unix):

1. Install the free QT development SDK (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
3. Download this project either using git checkout, or just downloading the project from the Downloads button above.
4. Open the project (Imagine.pro in the top level directory) with Qt Creator (included with the SDK above).
5. Click build, then run!
