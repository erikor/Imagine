INSTALLATION:

A windows binary will be made available soon from the Downloads button above.

BUILDING FROM SOURCE:

Pre-requisites: This application needs libtiff (www.libtiff.org). Libtiff is preinstalled on Mac Os X and many unix systems.  Windows users will need to download the library (and dependencies...also available from the above link) and put them somewhere on your PATH (such as c:/windows/system32/).

Then download the source and build the application for your system (windows, mac, linux, unix):

1. Install the free QT development SDK (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
3. Download this project either using git checkout, or just downloading the project from the Downloads button above.
4. Open the project (Imagine.pro in the top level directory) with Qt Creator (included with the SDK above).
5. Click build, then run!
